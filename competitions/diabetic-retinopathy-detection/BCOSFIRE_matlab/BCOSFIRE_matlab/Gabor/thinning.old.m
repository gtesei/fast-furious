% THINNING: reduces the edges to a width of 1 pixel. This is done 
%           by looking at the two pixels next to the current pixel.
%           the neighbourpixels are determined by the orientation of 
%           the current point (this is stored in the exact same location
%           as in the matrix ORIENSMATRIX). A progressbar of the
%           calculations is also shown. 
%   THINNING(MATRIX, ORIENSMATRIX, METHOD) thins the edge
%      MATRIX - the matrix which should be thinned
%      ORIENSMATRIX - the matrix which holds for every pixel of MATRIX the
%                     orientation (in the same position)
%      METHOD - the method of thinning: METHOD == 1: simple method, just
%               take the value of the nearest pixels to compare with.
%               e.g. if the orientation = 20 degrees, the points S & N are chosen
%               to compare to, if the orientation = 25 degrees the points SW & NE
%               are chosen (see below, P = current point)
%                             NW  N  NE
%                             W   P   E
%                             SW  S  SE
%               METHOD == 2: the values to compare with are calculated using
%               interpolation based on the surrounding pixels (NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W)

      % normally the same pixels would be checked if (dy and dx > 0) and (dy and dx < 0). because
      % different pixels should be checked with a gabor-orientation of 45 and 135 this difference should
