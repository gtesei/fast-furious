% GABORFILTER: calculates all the convolutions of the input image IMG with
% the Gabor-filterkernels for all combinations of orientations (which are 
% stored in the array THETA) and all phase-offsets (as stored in the array PHI) with the input image IMG. 
% The result is a 4-dimensional matrix of which the first two indices are the image-coordinates,
% the third index is the phaseoffset, the fourth index is the orientation.
% i.e. RESULT(:,:,phaseoffset(i),orientation(j)).
% A progressbar of the calculations is also shown.
%   GABORFILTER(IMG, LAMBDA, SIGMA, THETA, PHI, GAMMA, BANDWIDTH) calculates
%   all convolutions as described above, with the following parameters:
%     IMG - a matrix with values (an already read input image)
%     LAMBDA - preferred wavelength (wavelength of the cosine factor) of a Gabor function
%     SIGMA - standard deviation of Gaussian factor
%     THETA - list of all orientations
%     PHI   - list of all phase-offsets              
%     GAMMA - spatial aspect ratio (of the x- and y-axis of the Gaussian elipse) 
%     BANDWIDTH - spatial frequency bandwidth
%     To use the BANDWIDTH, one of the parameters SIGMA or LAMBDA must
%     contain the value 0. Otherwise BANDWIDTH is ignored.

% CREATEFFTIMAGE: convolves IMG with FILTERKERNEL (by use of fft). The size of the convolution
%                 is of the size wich is also used in CONVOLUTION. This method is included
%                 because now the calculation of the FFT of the image (which is the same
%                 every time) has to be carried out only once).
%   CREATEFFTIMAGE(IMG, FILTERKERNEL) convolves
%     IMG - the matrix which should be convolved with the:
%     FILTERKERNEL - the filterkernel to convolve IMG with in the frequency domain

% initialize values
[fh, fw] = size(filterkernel); % size of the kernel is fh x fw
[imh,imw] = size(img); % size of the image is imh x imw

% the size of the convolution should be an even number
% Note: for more efficiency use max(fw, imw) instead of fw+imw (and idem for
% the height). Speedups are considerable (approximately a factor 2!). This results 
% in artefacts near the image borders though. 
% Remember to ALSO uncomment this in 'convolution.m'
nh = (fh + imh) + mod(fh + imh, 2);
nw = (fw + imw) + mod(fw + imw, 2);
% nh = (max(fh,imh)) + mod(max(fh,imh), 2);
% nw = (max(fw,imw)) + mod(max(fw,imw), 2);

% Calculate the size difference between the image & the convolution size
cix = fix((nw - imw)/2); 
ciy = fix((nh - imh)/2); 

% Calculate the size difference between the filterkernel & the convolution size
cfx = ceil((nw - fw)/2);
cfy = ceil((nh - fh)/2);

resultimg = padarray(img, [ciy cix], 'symmetric', 'both'); % symmetric padding
result = fft2(resultimg, nh, nw); % calculate the fft
