% CALC_HALFWAVERECT: calculates all half-wave rectifications of the matrices
% stored in the 4-dimensional matrix MATRICES. Half-wave rectification is calculated of 
% a percentage of the maximum value stored in each 2-dimensional matrix.
% A progressbar of the calculations is also shown.
%   CALC_HALFWAVERECT(MATRICES, THETA, PHI, HWPERC) with the following parameters:
%     MATRICES - the matrices which should be half-wave rectified
%     THETA - list of all orientations
%     PHI - list of all phase-offsets              
%     HWPERC - half-wave rectification is calculated according to a percentage of the maximum
%              value, all values below the percentage are set to 0, the rest remains
%              unchanged (e.g. percentage of 10: every value below 10% of the maximum value
%              is set to 0, percentage of 100: only the maximum value is retained)
%              note that if half-wave rectification is applied (a numerical value is stored in
%              HWPERC) the negative values are ALWAYS set to 0 (e.g. a percentage of 0 
%              only sets the negative values to 0)
