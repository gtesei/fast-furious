% EVALPERFORMANCE: calculates a performance measure based on the comparison
% of the two binary contourmaps (CONTOURIMAGE and DESIREDOUTPUT). The exact
% method is described in [IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 12, No. 7, July 2003, p. 733:
% Contour Detection Based on Nonclassical Receptive Field Inhibition, C. Grigorescu, N. Petkov and M.A. Westenberg]
% For each pixel in the CONTOURIMAGE it is checked if there are pixels
% present in a REGIONSIZE x REGIONSIZE region of the DESIREDOUTPUT. If no
% pixels are present, the pixel of the CONTOURIMAGE is marked as false
% positive (FP), if there are pixels present, these are all marked in the
% DESIREDOUTPUT, the pixel in the CONTOURIMAGE is marked as correctly
% detected. After every pixel of the CONTOURIMAGE is checked, it is known
% how many pixels of the CONTOURIMAGE have been correctly detected, the
% number of FP's is also known and finally the number of false negatives is
% defined by counting the non-marked pixels in the DESIREDOUTPUT. 
%   EVALPERFORMANCE(CONTOURIMAGE, DESIREDOUTPUT, INVERT) with the following parameters:
%     CONTOURIMAGE - the black-and-white contourmap (every positive value is converted to 1)
%     DESIREDOUTPUT - the binary contourmap which is desired (every positive value is converted to 1)
%     INVERT - if this value is 1, the desiredoutput high and low values
%              should be flipped
%
% PRECONDITION: THE CONTOUR IMAGE SHOULD HAVE THE
% VALUE 1 for FOREGROUND(normally this is interpreted as white lines on a black
% background -- white is 1, black is 0).

% initialise variables

cardFP = 0; % number of false positives (identified as a 1, though it should have been a 0)

    % if there exists an edge in the contourimage AND a corresponding pixel

    % is placed in CI, otherwise a 0 is placed
    ci = min((contourimage == desiredoutputL(HREGION+1+I:sizeY+HREGION+I, HREGION+1+J:sizeX+HREGION+J)), (contourimage ~= 0)); 
    
    % the correctly detected pixels are each step added to the matrix
    % CORRECTDETECTED which stores all correctly detected pixels until now.
    % This matrix consists of 1's (if correctly detected) and 0's (not
    % correctly detected or no pixel in the contourimage present)
    correctdetected = max(ci, correctdetected); 
    
    % if a pixel in the region of the desiredoutput caused the addition of a 1 in CI, this pixel is 
    % marked (e.g. removed from the DESIREDOUTPUTNONMARKED). The unmarked pixels
    % remain as ones (1's) in the array desiredoutputTemp
    desiredoutputNonMarked(HREGION+1+I:sizeY+HREGION+I, HREGION+1+J:sizeX+HREGION+J) = ...
        max(desiredoutputNonMarked(HREGION+1+I:sizeY+HREGION+I, HREGION+1+J:sizeX+HREGION+J) - ci, 0);
