** train / test (merge with store)
- Sales - response 
- Customers - cut 

- Store 
- DayOfWeek       
- Date ~ dateNum , day , month , year     
- Open 
- Promo 
- StateHoliday 
- SchoolHoliday

- StoreType 
- Assortment 
- CompetitionDistancePred := -1 if Date < CompetitionOpenSinceDate | CompetitionDistance is NA, otherwise CompetitionDistance (even if CompetitionOpenSinceDate is NA)
- Promo2Pred := 0 if Promo2 is 0 | Promo2SinceDate < Date | Date not in Promo2Period , 1 otherwise
- Promo2SinceMonths := # months that Promo2 started 

* evaluate (add these predictors one by one)
- SalesLastYearsDay := Sales of last years in the same shop
- SalesLastYearWeek := Average Sales of last year in the same week 

** feature selection 
- Open = 1 
- Sales >0 ?  

** metric 
- RMSPE : not takes into account Sales == 0 in days Open  (54 cases Shop / day , 41 stores)
- RMSE  : takes into account Sales == 0 in days Open

** resampling 
- it seems that train period is before test period (~ 1,5 months)
